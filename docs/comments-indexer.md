## Comment Indexer is the engine that makes global comment sharing on Multisite possible.

It works behind the scenes to catalog your comments, providing a foundation for other plugins to display your content in new and exciting ways.

### Manage Multisite Comments in New Ways

We built Comment Indexer to work together with other plugins to harness its power.

While Multisite is a powerful tool, one of its biggest limitations is the lack of control you have for displaying comments and content from different sites on your network in one place.

We've built a huge collection of plugins that can help you do that, but those plugins need an index of all the different comments and posts on your network to pull from. This is where Comment Indexer comes in.

### Expand Global Comments

We've developed a robust collection of plugins that work around Comment Indexer to extend Multisite's capabilities.

* **Recent Global Author Comments Feed** – Display a global feed of comments from a single author made across multiple sites on the network
* **Recent Global Comments Widget** – Display the latest comments from across your entire network
* **Recent Global Comments Feed** – Provide a RSS feed of the latest comments on your network
* **Post Index Summary** – Provide an overview of indexed post types and most indexed sites
* **Post Indexer Stats and Graphs** – Post Indexer helps you keep track of exactly what is being stored on your global index with rich statistics and graphs
* **Indexed Post Types** – A simple graph that visually illustrates indexed post types by usage percent
* **Recently Indexed Posts** – View and access recently indexed content with linked post titles and site names
* **Most Indexed Posts** – View a clear, bold bar graph to see what posts have been indexed most

## Reimagine What Multisite Can Do
